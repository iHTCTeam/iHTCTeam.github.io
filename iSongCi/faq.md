description: Comprehensive FAQ for iSongCi — offline Song Ci, daily ci, reading, widgets, Siri and iCloud.
---

<section lang="en" markdown="1">

### Is the app fully offline?

Yes. All **21,592 Song Ci works** are bundled. After install the app makes **zero outbound network requests** — no account, no ads, no analytics. Optional iCloud uses Apple's service only when you enable it.

### How is this different from Tang poetry / generic poetry apps?

iSongCi is **vertical to Song Ci (宋词)** — not a mixed Tang/Song/Yuan poetry catalog. It adds **1,461 cipai** knowledge, **plain translation & modern commentary**, **immersive vertical reading** with pinyin, daily ci, share cards, widgets, Control Center, Siri, and optional iCloud.

### How much content is included?

| Item | Count |
|------|-------|
| Ci works (total) | 21,592 |
| Authors | 1,509 |
| Cipai (tune patterns) | 1,461 |
| Featured cipai with intro | 60 |
| Plain translations | 11,029 |
| Modern commentary | All works |
| Collections | 12 (Haofang 363 · Wanyue 520 · 10 theme sets) |
| Dynasties | Five Dynasties, Northern Song, Southern Song |

### What are plain translation, classical notes, and modern commentary?

Three separate layers on the detail page — toggle each section independently:

- **Plain translation (白话译文)** — modern Chinese rendering of the full text (~11,029 works)
- **Classical notes (注释)** — traditional scholarly annotations where available
- **Modern commentary (白话赏析)** — auto-generated background, gist, and reading tips for every work (for reference, not academic citation)

### Do all works have translations?

No. **11,029** works include a full plain translation; the rest show original text plus modern commentary. Classical notes appear only when source data includes them. The app is a reading & discovery studio, not a full academic edition of every ci.

### How does Today's Ci work?

A piece is chosen **deterministically from the featured pool** (Haofang + Wanyue masterpieces) using the **calendar day as seed** — everyone sees the **same ci on the same date**. It rolls over at **local midnight**. Open from **Home** or `isongci://daily`.

### What is Serendipity?

**邂逅一词** draws a **random** piece from the featured pool — different each tap. Use **Home → Serendipity**, `isongci://random`, the **Random Ci** widget, or Siri.

### How accurate is pinyin?

Pinyin is **auto-generated** per segment. It works well for most lines but **may misread polyphonic characters** (多音字). Use it as a reading aid, not a pronunciation authority.

### Traditional Chinese display?

UI has dedicated **繁體中文** strings. Corpus text is stored in simplified Chinese and **converted at display time** (character-level s2t table) for Traditional mode — you don't need two copies of the database.

### How do vertical reading and pinyin work?

Turn on globally in **Settings → Reading** (vertical layout, pinyin, calligraphy font). In any work detail you can open **Immersive Reading** for a full-screen vertical (right-to-left) or horizontal page with xuan-paper background and independent font scaling.

### What is Immersive Reading?

**Detail → More → Immersive Reading** opens a chrome-free page — ideal for reciting or presenting on iPad or a large screen. Switch vertical/horizontal and calligraphy inside the reader.

### How do I change font size?

**Settings → Reading** slider, or **Detail → More → Font size**. Scales body text independently of system Dynamic Type; syncs via iCloud if enabled.

### How does read-aloud (TTS) work?

Tap the **speaker** icon on the detail toolbar. Uses on-device Mandarin speech synthesis. Pause and resume with the same button.

### How do favorites, notes, and iCloud work?

**Favorites** — tap ♥ on any work. **Private notes** — per-poem annotations only you can see (detail page). Optional **iCloud Sync** mirrors favorites, notes, appearance, font scale, tab visibility, and reading streak across devices. **Ci text is never uploaded** — it always stays in the app bundle.

### What are the reading streak rules?

Open **any ci** in the app to count for that calendar day. **Consecutive days** increment your streak; **skip more than one day** and the streak resets to zero on next open. **Total read count** tracks lifetime pieces opened. Streak appears on Home and the **Reading Streak** widget.

### What share card styles exist?

**13 styles:** Classic, Ink Wash, Cinnabar Seal, Silk Scroll, Scroll Long, Ochre Gold, Winter Snow, Green Landscape, Bamboo Slips, Moonlit Silver, Minimal, Dark Minimal, Vertical Script. Choose full text or excerpt; optionally include commentary; export PNG at 3× resolution.

### Which widgets are available?

| Widget | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Today's Ci | Today's highlighted piece |
| Serendipity | Random featured ci (refreshes hourly) |
| Favorite Ci | Latest starred work |
| Reading Streak | Consecutive days + total read count |
| Control Center | One-tap open Today's Ci (iOS 18+) |

Sizes: Small / Medium / Large on Home Screen; Lock Screen circular, inline, or rectangular. Supports **StandBy**. Widget language follows **in-app language**, not system language.

### Widget shows wrong or empty text?

1. Open the app once after install
2. Pull to refresh on Home to rewrite widget cache
3. After changing language, open the app briefly to refresh
4. **Favorite Ci** needs at least one starred work
5. **Reading Streak** needs you to open a work inside the app first
6. Ensure widgets are allowed for iSongCi in system settings

### What is the Control Center widget (iOS 18+)?

Add **Today's Ci** from **Settings → Control Center** (or system Control Center editor). Requires **iOS 18.0+**. Tapping opens the app directly to today's piece.

### What Siri shortcuts exist?

Three App Intents ship with the app:

| Intent | Example phrase |
|--------|----------------|
| Open Today's Ci | "Today's ci in iSongCi" |
| Random Ci | "Serendipity in iSongCi" |
| Search Ci | "Search in iSongCi" (with keyword) |

Configure up to **4 Home Screen quick actions** in Settings. Full deep-link list in [Shortcut Links](url-scheme).

### What are Spotlight limitations?

Spotlight indexes the **featured pool plus your favorites** — up to **~1,000** entries. Rare works won't appear in system search; use **in-app deep full-text search** instead (lazy-loads the full corpus). Tap a Spotlight result to open that ci directly.

### Can I hide tabs?

Yes. **Settings → Tab Bar** — toggle **Categories** and/or **Favorites** tabs. Hidden tabs remain reachable via detail actions, long-press menus, widgets, and `isongci://` links.




|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Home Screen quick actions | ✅ | ❌ |
| Widgets & Control Center | ✅ (iOS 18+ CC) | Widgets primarily on iPhone/iPad |
| Haptic feedback | ✅ | ❌ |
| Dedicated Search tab | iOS 26+ | Search via button / sheet |
| Core reading, favorites, iCloud | ✅ | ✅ |

### Is the app free? What is the tip jar?

**Completely free** — all 21,592 works and every feature, no subscription, no ads. An **optional tip jar** (`com.iHTCboy.iSongCi.6`) lets you support development via Apple In-App Purchase; it unlocks nothing extra.

### System requirements

| Platform | Minimum |
|----------|---------|
| iPhone / iPad | iOS 17.0+ |
| Mac | macOS 13.0+ |
| Control Center widget | iOS 18.0+ |

### How do I get the app?

[Download on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6788433450) (App ID **6788433450**).

### How do I contact support?

[AppleOSer@gmail.com](mailto:AppleOSer@gmail.com) — we typically reply within 48 hours.

---

### How does continuous reading work?

Enable **continuous reading** in Settings → Reading. After a work finishes TTS, a bottom bar appears; if you do nothing for a few seconds, the next item in the current queue (browse / playlist / favorites / daily) starts automatically. You can also pick lines when generating share cards.

### How do daily reminders work?

Optional **local notifications** remind you to read today's ci. Tap the notification to open the matching work via deep link. Disabling notifications does not clear your reading streak.

## Complete User Guide

The sections below are the full product walkthrough previously on the support page. Quick Q&A items remain above (if any).

---

## Part 1 — First Launch & Interface

### Welcome guide

On first launch, a **multi-page welcome guide** introduces the app — library scale, daily ci, immersive reading, favorites, widgets, and privacy. Swipe through each page, then tap **Get Started**. Replay anytime: **Settings → Help → Usage Guide** or deep link `isongci://feature-guide`.

### Tab bar overview

> **Tip:** Hide the **Browse** or **Favorites** tab in **Settings → Tab Bar**. If you close the tab you're on, the app returns to Home automatically. Tab visibility syncs via optional iCloud.

### Platforms

| Platform | Minimum |
|----------|---------|

---

## Part 7 — Search

iSongCi offers **two-tier offline search** — fast metadata first, deep full-text when needed.

### Tier 1 — Instant metadata search

As you type, the app instantly matches against bundled metadata:

- **Titles** (ci names)
- **Author names**
- **Cipai names**
- **Tags and categories**

No loading spinner — results appear on every keystroke.

### Tier 2 — Lazy full-text deep search

For line-level matches inside ci bodies, the app lazily loads **`fulltext.json`** from the bundle on first deep-search use. After the one-time load, full-text search runs entirely on-device.

- Matches **any line** in the 21,592-work corpus
- Slightly slower on first launch of deep search; cached thereafter
- **Zero network** — file ships with the app

### Dedicated Search tab (iOS 26+)

On **iOS 26 and later**, Search has its own tab in the tab bar. On earlier versions, use the search field in **Browse** or system integrations below.

### Spotlight

The app indexes up to **~1,000 works** for system Spotlight search. Tap a Spotlight result to open that work directly in iSongCi.

### Siri & deep links

- Siri: *"Search in iSongCi"* (with keyword)
- Deep link: `isongci://search?q=明月`

### Search tips

| Tip | Why |
|-----|-----|
| Search author + keyword | Narrows large result sets |
| Try cipai name | Finds all works in a tune pattern |
| Use a famous line | Triggers full-text tier for line match |
| Search in Traditional Chinese | UI converts; corpus matches simplified source |

---

## Part 8 — Themes & Appearance

Open **Settings → Appearance**.

### Theme mode

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|

| **Dark** | Ink-dark night reading |

Accent color applies to: favorite stars, buttons, highlights, share-card accents, and widget tint (when **Follow app theme** is on).

### Language

**English / 简体中文 / 繁體中文** — UI switches instantly. Corpus text is stored in simplified Chinese; Traditional display uses on-device conversion.
